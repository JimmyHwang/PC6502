<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a 6502 Emulator for teach my children and people know what is assembly language and CPU how to start from RESET and work with different devices.
1. Why I choose this CPU as the teaching material? 
	I learn computer language from Apple II age, The 6502 is my most familiar CPU.
2. Is it only support 6502 CPU? 
	I try to adopt modular design as much as possible, so it is can add other CPU if I got time.
